# Pokedux
Messing around with React and Redux building a simplified Pokedex

In order to run the project locally you can do so by following the steps above:  
- Run `npm install` inside the project directory to download all the required dependencies  
- Run `npm start` to launch the local webpack server
- Visit http://localhost:8080/ in case it does not automatically open
- Have fun with the **endless** capabilities of the app by searching a pokemon by its name or id and watching it pop on the screen
